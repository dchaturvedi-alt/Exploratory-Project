# Exploratory-Project
We have solved here, the Travelling Salesman Problem using Discrete Spyder Monkey Optimization and applied it to the Vehicle Routing Problem.
We have also compared the results of solving TSP using DSMO with already implemented state of the art optimizations like the Artificial Bee Colony Optimization and Genetic Algorithms.
We have also implemented the Covering Salesman Problem using GA and ABC optimizations. The Covering Salesman Problem is a generalization of Travelling Salesman Problem.
